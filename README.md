# RustyHelperWindow
An attempt at a hotkey enabled, tool window.

If all goes well i'd like these functionalities;
- A window that pops up if Mouse5 gets pressed
- A default browser lookup text input that gets focused upon window opening
- A GUI with buttons that are labeled and have windows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_command">"run"</a> actions
- A [+] button that allows you to enter a "run" command and a button label, these should be saved in a .json on your system for use in the window.
- A [-] button that allows you to remove a command you've set earlier
- The Gui should resize according to the amount of buttons you have
- The window should pop up wherever the cursor is when the M5 button is pressed
- Pressing the M5 button when the window is open should close it again
- Pressing CTRL + M5 should exit the program.
